+ Hacked Arduino phone
	+ Other clues give a phone # to dial (or something)
	+ Arduino listens for the right key presses
	+ visual and audio feedback (phone lights up etc)
	+ buttons have LEDs that are part of the puzzle
	
+ Watches
	+ LEDs or inexpensive digital display screen
	+ or a simple grid/matrix of LEDs
	+ watches are synced up
	+ players get notified of time penalty etc
	+ each player has distinct color
	
+ Spy glasses
	+ find the glasses at some point
	+ necessary to solve final puzzle
	
+ Keypad
	+ after every challenge you get a number
	+ numbers have to be memorized*
		+ each player has to memorize a piece of it
	+ at the end you have to type the numbers in to get out
	+ have to check every combination
	+ for digits
	
+ Police negotiation/bribe
	+ Use phone to call in for more time
	+ Pay for time
	+ Could be to buy puzzle clues,
		+ have a hacker on the outside who can help
		
+ Scrambling to solve puzzle
	+ focus changes from money puzzle to alarm
	+ a roadblock
	+ forces players to disperse to solve simon says like puzzle
	+ randomized simple input required on a computer or something
	+ all four players have to do some simple input to disable 

+ alarm
	+ to disable
		+ could be sequential or simultaneous
		+ could be symbol or number or letter
	+ gets louder and louder unless puzzle is solved
		+ if it gets too loud police come, game over, GG
	
+ sound immersion
	+ 3-d spatial audio
		+ players have to go to or go away from sound?
	+ sound should act as feedback to propell players
	+ a shared vocabulary throughout so players understand the flow
	+ police sirens tell players they are about to run out of time
	+ could be used to actually distract players
	
	
+ each mechanism can be thought of as a level
	+ evolving skillset, think of mario 4-panel design
	+ at the end all mechanisms must be used together
	
+ central terminal
	+ gives a sense of progression
	+ screen changes after each puzzle
	+ tells people what "level" they are on

+ plan B
	 + always an alternative way to solve a puzzle
	 + or you get one plan B per game

+ individualized money scores
	+ people work together when necessary
	+ but people are trying to win individually

+ ...
	+ players dont get extracted at the same time
		+ at the end only one or two players left
	+ one player can have a malfunctioning watch or something
		+ other players have to work 2gether to fix it
	
+ leaderboard
	+ high scores for teams
	+ visible during play?
	
+ L4Z3RZ
	+ lasers are an active hazard
	+ limit mobility of players during game
	+ tripping a laser has a penalty
	+ laser positioning has a pattern
	+ mirror needed to point laser at a specific point
	+ laser puzzle for players to leave the room
		+ maybe players can get a laser pointer object of some kind
		+ this can be used for laser trips
	+ might not need actual lasers, could projection map
	+ use photocells to sense lasers
	+ lasers could be there for looks, but actually using other sensors etc
	+ physical trip wires
	
	
+ Wire connection
	+ maybe patch bay
	+ players have to connect the right things physically
	+ LEDs light up as puzzle gets more solved
	+ utilize same visual language from other puzzles
		+ symbols?
		+ colors?

+ create a recording of players
	+ moments of stress
	+ gif timelapse
		+ points overlay
	+ highlight reel
	+ twitch channel for our game
	
	
+ display time and $$ at all times
	+ could be on watches, another object, or projected on wall
	
	
+ codenames
