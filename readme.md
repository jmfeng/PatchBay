The idea patchbay was originated from connecting mutiple wires into the correct jacks, and making a sound or rythmn that matches correct polyrythmntic sequence coming from max and we use ardunio to commucitate with max throught serial connection witht the correct baud rate. One feature, We programmed in arundio that if the player gets the wrong connection a counter will be added, when player gets certain counter, the connection will be reseted to prevent players mix and match till the correct connection. Another feature, that we shuffle the correct connections so each time the counter resets the puzzle will be new and ready for the next team to interact.
