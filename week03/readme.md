# Week 03

## Demo

+ Hacking a USB keyboard (DIY Makey Makey)

## Begin Prototyping

+ Cardboard, paper, pens, scissors...
+ Create your proposed objects
	+ Map them out, what happens with them?
	+ What tech do we need underlying these objects?
	+ How can we get these objects to talk to one another?

## Moodboard

+ We want a consistent visual (and sonic) aesthetic
	+ We will maintain a "moodboard" folder on our repository with images and sounds akin to what we want for the project
